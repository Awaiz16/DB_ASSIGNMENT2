Challenges: 

ERD: The ERD was quite straightforward, however seeing how some questions required purchase history in a form a a string of purchases, additions needed to be made to the ERD to cater to that. Buyer, seller, and current owner information was added along with the already existing purchase date. Furthermore, some questions hinted towards some Airplanes already being in maintenance, which would render them not being able to fly. Thus, we had to cater to that with a Status attribute. An additional table of Routes was also added for extra information. 

Relational: Relational Diagram was alot easier to make once the ERD had been formed. By swapping the foreign keys and adjusting attributes, the final image of the database became very appearant.

Queries: Some questions could be interpreted in different ways. The question where we had to find the capacity of the hanger that has most available space proved to be tricky as it required to rank the capacities as well minus their capacity with their occupancy. This multi layered handling was very difficult.
